# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Coursera - Project Assignment

## This repo contains: 

### 1. Two tidy data sets derived from Smart Phone data provided by Coursera
a. SPselect.txt
b. SPavgs.txt

### 2. Codebook that explains origin of the data, measurements, and labels

### 3. R script that converts original data into tidy datasets and explains the process. As required, this script:
a. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
b. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
c. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
d. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
e. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
